One Button Ninja In A One Trick Pony World is a game I made for HiJam, a game jam hosted by the Game Jam Club at Humber College, in about 40 hours. The theme of the jam was "one button".

The game operates from start to finish using only mouse left click. The player needs to shift the world between light and darkness to open a path for 1B Ninja.

I worked on everything in the game except the audio and the fonts as they were free assets and belong to their respective owners.
